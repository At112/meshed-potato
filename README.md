 Deploy very simplistic REST API on Cloud of your choice (AWS, GCP, Azure, …) with IaaC. 


For example, in AWS this could be deploying AWS Lambda + AWS API Gateway with
AWS CloudFormation. 

 
 Additional questions: 
o What would you monitor on the app? 
o Which metrics would you set alerts on? 
o Can we deploy the whole setup in new account? (In terms of disaster
recovery) 
o How would you protect the API from public access?
